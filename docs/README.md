# ChatGPT, Numbers and the Meaning of Life!  

## Synopsis

What is the 'favorite' number of ChatGPT? 

This question is in the core of this project.

In order to address it, 
10000 responses were collected,
(through the ChatGPT's API)
each time requesting ChatGPT agent, 
for the same thing:  

> 'give a number'

The raw responses were collected and stored in a database.

Then the raw data was processed 
in order to extract the number from the response 
(which was returned in various formats from the agent) 
and stored in another database.

After summarizing the results it was apparent
that there was a huge bias in favor of certain numbers.

## Nerd Mythology and Fun!

..42!! Really 42..

Although there is no doupt that the agent is of narrow intelligence, 
giving back this number is quite funny if one takes into account the 
classic novel 'Hitchkoc's Guide to the Galaxy' according to which..

.. SPOILER ALERT ..

42 is The Meaning of Life! 

Isn't the irony quite apparent! 

Having a bot that is one step behind passing the 'Turing Test' 
giving this iconic number back in such frequency makes the imagination tick.
Does the bot hides something?? Is it some code for his fellow bots or a message for humanity?
For sure a decent 'Black Mirror' episode could be made out of this!
